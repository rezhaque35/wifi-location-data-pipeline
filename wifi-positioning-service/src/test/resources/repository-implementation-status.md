# WiFi Positioning Service - Repository Implementation Status

## Project Status

The repository implementation has been successfully simplified and enhanced with in-memory testing capabilities. 

### Verification Results

All tests are passing for the standalone repository implementation:

```
== Verifying basic add and find operations ==
Empty results: PASS
Single result: PASS
Correct MAC address: PASS
Correct version: PASS
Correct SSID: PASS

== Verifying scenario data loading ==
Proximity scenario loaded: PASS
Proximity method correct: PASS
Proximity confidence correct: PASS
Collinear APs loaded: PASS
Weak signal scenario loaded: PASS
Weak signal strength correct: PASS
```

### Implementation Details

1. **Repository Interface Simplification**:
   - Reduced to the essential `findByMacAddress` method needed for the positioning service
   - Removed all unused methods that weren't part of the core workflow

2. **In-Memory Repository Implementation**:
   - Created a thread-safe implementation for testing
   - Added data loading methods for various test scenarios
   - Included proper profile annotations to use only in test environment

3. **DynamoDB Implementation**:
   - Reduced to only implement the required method
   - Added profile annotation to avoid loading during tests
   - Maintained proper error handling and logging

4. **Test Scenarios**:
   - Loaded test data based on the `load-test-data.sh` script
   - Implemented various positioning algorithm scenarios
   - Included edge cases like weak signals and collinear access points

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Update dependent services and tests**:
   - Update `PositioningServiceImpl` and other services to only use the `findByMacAddress` method
   - Modify any test classes that expect other repository methods

2. **Create a mock repository for integration tests**:
   - Use a mock or stub implementation for integration tests
   - Pre-load test data relevant to the test cases

3. **Update documentation**:
   - Document the simplified repository approach in the project README
   - Update API documentation to reflect the changes

## Benefits

This simplified approach:
- Removes unnecessary code complexity
- Speeds up test execution without DynamoDB dependencies
- Makes builds more reliable in CI/CD environments
- Provides clear test scenarios aligned with the positioning algorithms

## Test Data

The repository now supports loading test data for:

1. Proximity Detection (Single AP)
2. RSSI Ratio Method (Two APs)
3. Trilateration (Three APs)
4. Weak Signals (Low signal strength)
5. Collinear APs (Testing geometric distribution)

Additional scenarios can be easily added following the same pattern in `InMemoryWifiAccessPointRepository`.
