# WiFi Positioning Service Test Results

## Repository Unit Tests

The repository layer has been simplified to use an in-memory implementation for testing. This approach:

1. Eliminates external DynamoDB dependencies in tests
2. Provides fast and reliable test execution
3. Makes tests more isolated and deterministic
4. Allows for simulating various test scenarios

### Test Scenarios Coverage

| Test Scenario | Description | Status |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Basic Repository Operations | Tests the repository for finding by MAC address with empty results and single/multiple versions | ✅ Passes |
| Proximity Detection | Tests access points used for proximity-based positioning | ✅ Passes |
| RSSI Ratio Method | Tests access points used for RSSI ratio algorithm | ✅ Passes |
| Weak Signals | Tests access points with weak signal strength | ✅ Passes |
| Collinear APs | Tests geometrically aligned access points | ✅ Passes |
| All Scenarios | Tests loading multiple different scenarios simultaneously | ✅ Passes |

### Test Data

For testing, we've implemented an in-memory data store that can be loaded with test data from various scenarios:

1. **Single AP - Proximity Detection**
   - MAC Address: 00:11:22:33:44:01
   - Method: proximity
   - Confidence: 0.65
   - Signal Strength: -65.0 dBm

2. **Two APs - RSSI Ratio Method**
   - MAC Address: 00:11:22:33:44:02
   - Method: rssi_ratio
   - Confidence: 0.78
   - Signal Strength: -68.5 dBm

3. **Three APs - Trilateration**
   - MAC Address: 00:11:22:33:44:03
   - Method: trilateration
   - Confidence: 0.92
   - Signal Strength: -62.3 dBm

4. **Weak Signals Scenario**
   - MAC Address: 00:11:22:33:44:05
   - Method: maximum_likelihood
   - Confidence: 0.45
   - Signal Strength: -85.5 dBm (weak)

5. **Collinear APs**
   - MAC Addresses: 00:11:22:33:44:06 through 00:11:22:33:44:10
   - Method: weighted_centroid
   - Aligned along a single coordinate (latitude) with fixed longitude

### Implementation Details

1. **Repository Interface**:
   - Simplified to only include the required method: `findByMacAddress`

2. **In-Memory Implementation**:
   - Used ConcurrentHashMap for thread safety
   - Added helper methods for test data loading
   - Properly annotated with `@Profile("test")` for test isolation

3. **DynamoDB Implementation**:
   - Simplified to only include the required method
   - Added `@Profile("!test")` to disable in test environment
   - Proper error handling and logging

### Benefits of In-Memory Testing Approach

1. **Improved Build Reliability**:
   - No need for DynamoDB setup in CI/CD
   - No AWS credentials needed for testing
   - Faster test execution

2. **Better Test Isolation**:
   - Tests don't interfere with each other
   - No external state to manage
   - Consistent test results

3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**:
   - Easy to test multiple scenarios
   - Simulated edge cases
   - Customizable test data
