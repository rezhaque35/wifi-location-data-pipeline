# Firehose Ingestion Pipeline Task List (Terraform + LocalStack)

This document tracks the step-by-step implementation of the Kinesis Firehose-based ingestion pipeline for WiFi scan data, using **Terraform** for infrastructure as code and **LocalStack** for local AWS emulation, as described in [firehose_ingestion_requirements.md](firehose_ingestion_requirements.md).

## Phase 0: LocalStack Environment Setup

- [x] **Install and set up LocalStack on local machine**  
  _Install Docker Desktop (if not already), pull LocalStack Docker image, and (optionally) install LocalStack CLI or Docker Desktop extension. Verify LocalStack can start and is accessible at http://localhost:4566._

## Phase 1: Terraform Project & LocalStack Setup

- [x] **Create Terraform project skeleton and environments**  
  _Create `terraform/`, `modules/`, and environment variable files._
- [x] **Configure AWS provider for LocalStack**  
  _Set provider endpoints and credentials for LocalStack compatibility._
- [x] **Start LocalStack with required services**  
  _Services: kinesis, firehose, s3, events, sqs, iam, logs._

## Phase 2: Implement Core Terraform Modules (see firehose_ingestion_requirements.md for all resource details)

- [x] **Implement S3 module**  
  _Bucket name: `ingested-wifiscan-data`, partitioning, event notifications._
- [x] **Implement Kinesis Firehose module**  
  _Stream name: `wifi-scan-ingestion-stream`, buffering, compression, S3 destination._
- [x] **Implement SQS module**  
  _Queue name: `wifi_scan_ingestion_event_queue`, DLQ, retention, visibility._
- [x] **Implement IAM module**  
  _Roles: firehose-delivery-role, s3-eventbridge-role, eventbridge-sqs-role, permissions._
- [x] **Implement EventBridge module**  
  _Rule: wifi-scan-s3-put-rule, event pattern, SQS target._
- [x] **Add module blocks to main.tf and wire up dependencies**
- [x] **Deploy infrastructure to LocalStack using Terraform**  
  _Run `terraform apply` with LocalStack variables._
- [x] **Verify resource creation and configuration in LocalStack**  
  _Check S3, Firehose, SQS, EventBridge, IAM roles._

## Phase 3: Integration & Data Flow Testing

- [x] **Test data flow from Firehose to S3**  
  _Send sample data, verify S3 file creation and naming convention._
- [x] **Verify S3 event notifications trigger EventBridge and SQS**  
  _Check that .txt file creation triggers EventBridge rule and SQS message._
- [x] **Validate file naming, partitioning, and event patterns**
- [ ] **Test error handling and dead letter queue functionality**

## Phase 4: Production-Ready Terraform & AWS Deployment

- [ ] **Configure AWS provider for production**  
  _Set up credentials, remote state, and environment-specific variables._
- [ ] **Deploy infrastructure to AWS using Terraform**  
  _Run `terraform apply` with production variables._
- [ ] **Verify production resource configuration and monitoring**

## Phase 5: Automation, CI/CD, and Documentation

- [ ] **Set up automated testing pipeline for Terraform**  
  _Lint, validate, and test infrastructure code._
- [ ] **Implement infrastructure validation and compliance checks**  
  _Use tools like Terratest, Checkov, Kitchen-Terraform._
- [ ] **Document operational runbooks and troubleshooting**  
  _Update docs in `wifi-scan-ingestion/firehose-ingestion/documents/`._

## Script and Documentation Organization

- All setup, configuration, and test scripts should be placed in:  
  `wifi-scan-ingestion/firehose-ingestion/scripts/`
- Terraform code and modules should be organized in:  
  `wifi-scan-ingestion/firehose-ingestion/terraform/`
- Troubleshooting, monitoring, and operational runbooks should be documented in:  
  `wifi-scan-ingestion/firehose-ingestion/documents/`
